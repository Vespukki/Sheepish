  _description: "The fish in this pond don't really seem to share any common traits,
    so you decided to name it 'Tutor's Pond' after Robert Tutor, a man you have never
    met. You think, however, that he used to live nearby, and perhaps he was a gruff,
    silent sort who spent his days making furniture for his neighbors. He would get
    finished with a hard day's work and come to this pond to fish and clear his mind.
    Perhaps he even wore fun shirts and hats that described the complex relationship
    between fish, women, and himself. Of course, this is all hypothetical, and there
    is very little proof that this man ever existed. Even so, you can't help but
    hope that Robert lived a happy, full life. \r"

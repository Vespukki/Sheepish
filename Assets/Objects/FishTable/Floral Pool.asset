  _description: It seems a shipment of fertilizer fell into this pond a long time
    ago, which allowed the local flora to thrive and develop a symbiotic relationship
    with the fish living in it. You've decided to name it 'Floral Pool', after the
    colorful fish that reside in it. You could have named it 'Mossy Pool', but a
    mossfish bit you while you were thinking up a name, so you didn't want to give
    him any glory by naming a pond after him.
